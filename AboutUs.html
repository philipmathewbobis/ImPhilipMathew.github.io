	<p>Hi, I am Philip Mathew G. Bobis, 19 years old. I was born in Manila, but i was raised here in Caloocan. Growing up, i enjoyed my youth days with my friends when i was little, back then i was a headache to my parents.</p>

	<p>I am always in trouble, the cause of trouble, you know just enjoying my life and exploring different kind of things.</p>
	<p>But now many things have changed, not only my age but my perspective in life, to do better, to always think of what things are in the way in the future and specially for my family.</p>
	<p>Back then my dream is just to live happy but that's not the reality of life, but i am glad of what things i have now, specially we work and study hard for our family because they are our inspiration of the things we do.</p>
	<p>I hope we do things not just for ourselves but for the people that surrounds us, love us and care for us.
	By this we will appreciate things that comes in our life even it is small or big for us. Just don't forget to be thankful</p>
	<p>no matter what comes to you, That's all, Thank you!! </p>
